For competition binding curves to be considered <i>steep sigmoidal</i> then the extent of %Specific Binding covered by logIC<sub>50</sub> ± 1.0 should be greater than 80% - if it is less than 80% then the curve is considered <i>shallow sigmoidal</i>.  Notice in the Table below the analysis of the Shape / Position of each of the curves, and the conclusion that all competition binding curves are <i>steep sigmoidal</i>. This is suggestive that each of the competing ligands is binding to a single population of receptors for which they have a particular affinity (M<sub>1</sub> or M<sub>2</sub> or M<sub>3</sub> or M<sub>4</sub> or M<sub>5</sub>).  It is unlikely that there is more than one receptor subtype present as none of the five competition binding curves is <i>shallow sigmoidal</i>.</p>

                            The Quiz Tool works off the same premise as the Self-Assessment tool, where any one question is randomly selected from a list of 75 options (i.e. up to two receptor subtypes with relative densities between 20-80%, using 10% increments).

                    <p class="justify">
                        Most drugs work by binding to specific receptors, which are large proteins typically expressed
                        on the surface of cells.</p>
                    <p class="justify">The process of drug binding requires the existence of affinity (chemical forces
                        of attraction)
                        between the drug and receptor, and can be readily described by relatively simple mathematical
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p class="justify">As drug binding is essential for drug action, pharmacology students need to have
                        an advanced level of understanding of how changes in the affinity of a drug for a receptor can
                        influence binding,
                        and be able to readily interpret drug binding data.</p>
